    <h3>Simple Git Commands to Git Started</h3>

    <p>Basically I am just noting the precise steps I need to take in order to set up a new project using visual studio code, the terminal, git and github. Just trying to get things laid out in an organized way has been tricky for me. I find it important to have a solid base and to build from there...so this page is to be a part of that foundation.</p>
    <h4>Step by Step Project Setup</h4>
  
    <ol>
        <li>Create a folder on your desktop</li>
        <li>Open in Visual Studio Code</li>
        <li>Add files/folders</li>
        <li>OPen Terminal</li>
        <li>git init</li>
        <li>ls -a</li>
        <li>git status</li>
        <li>add files to staging area using git add</li>
        <li>git commit -file name- -m"message on commit"</li><br>
        <li>git push...if it is your first time see steps below</li>
  </ol>
  
    <h3>First Time Pushing to Github</h3>
  
    <p>If you have not pushed any commits to github from this project before you will need to follow the steps below your first time. Once you have made your first push then you will only need to use the 'git push' command each time you want to save commits to your online repository.</p>
  
      <ol>
         <li>Go to github.com and sign in to your account.</li>
         <li>Make a new blank repository, do not add the readme file at this time.</li>
         <li>Return to the terminal and use the command $git remote add origin "link to repo" The link to the repo is listed on the repository page, you may simply copy it and paste it into the command line.</li>
         <li>git push -u origin master</li>
      </ol>
  
    <p>Once you have connected your local project to your github repository then you can simply commit, then use git push.</p>
  
    <p>Once you are set up and have your files connected to git hub, then the process of saving versions of your work is simple and streamlined. Here it is...</p>
  
      <ol>
          <li>git add</li>
          <li>git commit -m""</li>
          <li>git push</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How to Clone a Repository from Github to your Local computer</h3>

      <ul>
        
            <li>On Github navigate to the repo you want to clone to your computer</li>
            <li>Click Clone and copy the url posted there</li>
            <li>Open Git Bash</li>
            <li>Change Directory (cd) to the one you want to place the repo in</li>
            <li>Git Init</li>
            <li>Git Clone --url of remote repo--</li>
            <li>Git Remote add origin --url of remote repo--</li>
            <p>Once you have cloned the repo then do the git pull command to bring the files from your remote repo to the desktop.</p></br>
            <li>Git Pull --url of remote repo--</li>
        </ul>
  
     <p>And thats it you are all up to date and keeping each version you make along the way.</p>
