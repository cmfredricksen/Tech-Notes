        <h3>About Me</h3>
        
        <p>I am learning front end development, and I am taking notes. The notes are a mess, piling up, getting hard to sort through so I decided to make use of them for content. So here is my page with notes I have taken. I have many more to add!</p>

    <h3 id="start">Simple Git Commands to Git Started</h3>

    <p>Basically I am just noting the precise steps I need to take in order to set up a new project using visual studio code, the terminal, git and github. Just trying to get things laid out in an organized way has been tricky for me. I find it important to have a solid base and to build from there...so this page is to be a part of that foundation.</p> 

    <h3>Step by Step Project Setup</h3>
  
    <ol>
        <li>Create a folder on your desktop - 
            This folder will contain your project files, such as your index, styles, scripts and images.
        </li>
        <li>Open in Visual Studio Code -
            You can do this by right clicking on your folder and selecting open with, then choose Visual Studio Code or your preferred editor.
        </li>
        <li>Add files/folders -
            Go to <strong>File > New</strong> and create your files. Examples are index.html, or style.css.
        </li>
        <li>Open Terminal - Go to <strong>Terminal > New Terminal</strong> and a new terminal window will open.</li>
        <li>On the command line type <strong> git init</strong> - This will initiate a repository for your folder. Git will start tracking your work.</li>
        <li>Type in <strong>ls -a</strong> and you will see the repository listed in the hidden files.</li>
        <li><strong>git status</strong> - This will show if your branch is up to date, what is staged, what is awaiting commit.</li>
        <li>add files to staging area using <strong>git add</strong> file_name (file name being your file name that you want to commit)</li>
        <li>Once you have added your files to the staging area you are ready to <strong>git commit</strong> file_name <strong> -m "message on commit"</strong>. You always add a message about the commit, like what changes you made.</li>
        <li><strong>git push</strong> This will push a copy of your repository to github. If it is your first time see the steps below</li>
    </ol>

    <a href="#top">=^.^=</a>
  
    <h3 id="1st">First Time Pushing to Github</h3>
  
    <p>If you have not pushed any commits to github from this project before you will need to follow the steps below your first time. Once you have made your first push then you will only need to use the 'git push' command each time you want to save commits to your online repository.</p>
  
      <ol>
         <li>Go to github.com and sign in to your account.</li>
         <li>Make a new blank repository, do not add the readme file at this time.</li>
         <li>Return to the terminal and use the command <strong>git remote add origin "link to repo"</strong> The link to the repo is listed on the repository page on github, you may simply copy it and paste it into the command line.</li>
         <li>Next, type in the command <strong>git push -u origin master</strong></li>
      </ol>
  
    <p>Once you have connected your local project to your github repository then you can simply commit, then use git push.</p>
  
    <p>Once you are set up and have your files connected to git hub, then the process of saving versions of your work is simple and streamlined. Here it is...</p>
  
      <ol>
          <li><strong>git add</strong> file_name</li>
          <li><strong>git commit</strong> file_name <strong> -m "message"</strong></li>
          <li><strong>git push</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="Github">How to Clone a Repository from Github to your Local computer</h3>

      <ul>
        
            <li>On Github navigate to the repo you want to clone to your computer</li>
            <li>Click Clone and copy the url posted there</li>
            <li>Open Git Bash (Terminal in Visual Studio Code)</li>
            <li>Change Directory (cd) to the one you want to place the repo in by typing <strong>cd</strong> directory_name (directory is the folder you are putting the files in.</li>
            <li><strong>Git Init</strong> will initiate version tracking with git.</li>
            <li><strong>Git Clone</strong> --url of remote repo--</li>
            <li><strong>Git Remote add origin</strong> --url of remote repo--</li>
            <p>Once you have cloned the repo then do the <strong>git pull</strong> command to bring the files from your remote repo to the desktop.</p>
            <li><strong>Git Pull</strong> --url of remote repo--</li>
        </ul><br>
  
     <p>And thats it you are all up to date and keeping each version you make along the way.</p><br>

     <h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>

     <p>These are random things I have figured out and dont want to forget.</p>

     <ul>
         <li>Once you have set up your initial project file, make a branch to work on. The original file will be automatically saved as 'master'. </li>
         <li>Work out your issues on your new branch, commit changes and then merge with master.</li>
         <li>Push changes to github.</li>
         
     </ul>
