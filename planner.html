                <p>I was looking for an online solution to planning and notetaking. I had some requirements:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>It had to be free.</li>
                 <li>It had to be cross platform.</li>
                 <li>It had to be accessible 24/7.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>I have always been a big planner user. I have used paper and electronic of all kinds. I normally stick with paper because I like to write and doodle, but the past few years I have had trouble keeping up with them. I have tried all kinds of things to re-ignite my interest and its not working.</p>

                <p>Recently I have been learning some basic web development, so I am spending more time on a computer than normal. Usually I do my business with an ipad, which isnt conducive to writing much.</p>

                <p>So I decided to find an online tracker of some kind. The challenge was I am using an old windows laptop and want to sync with my ipad and imac. </p>

                <p>It was hard to find what I was looking for, but finally I stumbled onto a solution and now I am sharing it here for other planner users.</p>

                <h5 id="start">Making a Cross Platform Planner Using Stackedit</h5>

                <p>Now we will build our planner, starting with the basics. Once you have it down it is pretty easy to expand it and tweak it to meet your needs.</p>

                <ol>
                    <h5>What you need:</h5>
                    <li>*A Google Account</li>
                    <p>I already had a Google Account and I was using gmail, youtube, analytics, etc etc.</p>
                    <li>*Stackedit</li>
                    <p>Simply go to <a href="stackedit.io">Stackedit</a> and you are ready to get started. Stackedit is entirely web based!
                    </p>  
                </ol>

                <h5>Once you are signed in to your Google Drive on stackedit...</h5>

            <div class="gallery">    
                <a href="images/IMG_6292.PNG">1. main screen</a>
                <img src="images/IMG_6292.PNG" alt="Home Screen in Stackedit" title="home screen in stackedit"></img>
                <p>1. This is the main screen you will be working on. On the left hand side you enter your markdown, or just type. The right hand column displays your work. The nice thing about stackedit is that there is a menu above for formatting so you dont really need to use markdown. But as you use the menu it will insert the markdown, so you can learn it pretty quick.</p>
                <a href="#top">Top</a>
                
                <a href="images/IMG_6993.PNG">2. Synch Menu</a>
                <img src="images/IMG_6293.PNG" alt="account setup"  title="where to set up your drive sync"></img>
                <p>2. In the upper right hand corner is the stackedit icon, click that to open your sychronization menu. In this menu you can link to your google drive and set up your preferences.</p>
                <a href="#top">Top</a>
                
                <a href="images/IMG_6295.PNG">3. File Manager</a>
                <img src="images/IMG_6295.PNG" alt="file explorer" ></img>
                <p>3. In the upper left hand corner is a file folder icon, click on that to open your file explorer. This is where you will set up your file system.</p>
                <a href="#top">Top</a>
            
                <h5>Setting up your planner</h5>

                <p>Once you have familiarized yourself with stackedit, then you can build the structure of your planner. The possibilities are endless, but I will tell you what I did and provide some templates to help you get started.</p>

                <p>I have the basic layout in photo number 3 above. I have added a few things since I took these pictures, but I think this is a great starting point and this is what I use most of the time.</p>

                <h6>calendar folder</h6>

                <P>I have a folder named calendar and it cotains a dated line for each day of the month. The days are divided into weeks. I use this to keep track of appointments and birthdays.</P>

                <p>There is also a master 2020 appointments list to keep track of everything for the year. It is handy for long term planning. I look at it a couple of times a month or as needed.</p>

                <h2>templates/samples</h2>

                <h6>diary folder</h6>

                <p>My most often used portion of this planner is the daily diary entries. I have a template that I use to structure each page/day. This includes sections:
                    <ol>
                        <li>task list</li>
                            <p class="small">checklist of daily tasks, like phonecalls I need to make, chores that need done, exercise etc. It is a schedule of sorts.</p>
                        <li>appointments</li>
                            <p class="small">list of appointments for the day including all the details such as time, place etc.</p>
                        <li>communications</li>
                            <p class="small">All communications with people via phone, email and in person. Actually I just note the important ones, but it is nice to have a record to refer back to.</p>
                        <li>health check</li>
                            <p class="small">Keep track of health related issues. What I eat, exercise I get, aches, pains, illness. I also keep notes on doctors visits here.</p>
                        <li>notes</li>
                            <p class="small">These are just my notes on the day, I might put anything in here from a movie I watched to how I feel about something. This area is a free for all!</p>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h6>Projects</h6>
                    <p>I keep track of projects using this folder. First of all, when I get an idea and want to make sure I remember it I just start a file in my projects folder. Once the file is there I can add to it as needed. If it becomes big enough I can make a folder to keep all of the files associated with said project.</p>

                <h6>Templates</h6>
                    <p>Here is where I keep my templates for the calendars and diaries. I have already set up the whole years monthly appointments and have them in the folder 'calendar'.</p>

                    <p>For my 'diary' I keep a folder for each month within the diary folder. Inside of that monthly folder I keep the dailies that are complete.</p>

                    <p>I keep the daily pages for the current week right in the diary folder. When the week is over I move them into the corresponding monthly folder. Then I make the following week's daily pages and add tasks and appointments.</p>
