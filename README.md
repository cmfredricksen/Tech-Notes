# three
I set up this repo to further practice using git and github to enhance my workflow. I am also learning html and css, plus visual studio code and terminal.

I am building a bunch of webpages with randomly generated content, ie. whatever comes to mind in the moment I need some space filler.

I want to learn the colors fonts and layout techniques to make beautiful clean sites. My sites will be art. 

Things I want to improve in:

html
css
grids
formatting
git
github
bash
responsive designs


things I want to learn but havent started yet:

javascript
database management
website deployment


ps...note: This is just pertaining to web development, I have several other things I am learning too. Slowly, but it is always interesting.
